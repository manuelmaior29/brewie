## Overview

After getting a coffee-making machine there are a lot of situations in which the extracted coffee does not end up to our expectations. Some of us enjoy a balanced taste with slight bitterness while others prefer to drink a slightly acid coffee. Considering this, the idea of developing an ML-based system, that could aid the extraction process, specifically providing tips for adjusting parameters from _grind size_, _coffee quantity_ and _extraction time_ up to _coffee origin_, in order to achieve the desired coffee taste.

## Data

Given that the application might be rather coffee machine dependent, the data used for implementing an ML-based, extraction settings optimization system, would be defined on the _Sage's the Barista Expressâ„¢_ machine (since this one is close at hand for me).
